This is the Travel Times iPhone application.  This application is built with HTML5 using
Sencha Touch to see how PhoneGap works.

An Android version will be completed soon.

The purpose of this application is to display real-time travel times based on the DOT
data.  Since Wisconsin DOT data is not provided in an usable format, I am screen-scraping
that data and providing it via a JSON feed to this application.
